# Lei Photos

This project focuses on a photo management application written in Java.
This version includes a graphical user interface (GUIClient) that supports several core features, such as:

- Viewing the contents of the main library and the trash through the provided views

- Browsing a set of predefined albums (double-click to open)

- Selecting one or more photos from the library and adding them to an album

- Deleting photos and deleting albums

Additionally, a separate command-line program, SimpleClient, is included to demonstrate and test various other functionalities of the application.
